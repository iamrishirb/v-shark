    <h5 class="">Benefits</h5>
    <p class="section-flag">V-shark is a remote monitoring and vulnerability assessment tool that can be used to monitor the remote systems with the help of a very small Window Utility. It can monitor the system for all the threats and vulnerabilities that might work like a backdoor for trojans, malwares and for hackers to sneak into your system and corrupt your data.

      This tool will actively keep monitoring your system for open ports, firewall status, AV Status, Open Applications etc. and will update the admin with the help of a centralised dashboard which the admin can take an action on.
      
      ** What is Vulnerability Assessment ** Vulnerability scanning or vulnerability assessment is a systematic process of finding security loopholes in any system addressing the potential vulnerabilities.
      
      The purpose of vulnerability assessments is to prevent the possibility of unauthorized access to systems. Vulnerability testing preserves the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The system refers to any computers, networks, network devices, software, web application, cloud computing, etc.</p>
<h5 >Types of Vulnerability Scanners</h5>
<p class="section-flag">Vulnerability scanners have their ways of doing jobs. We can classify the vulnerability scanners into four types based on how they operate.</p>
<h5 >Cloud-Based Vulnerability Scanners</h5>
<p class="section-flag">Used to find vulnerabilities within cloud-based systems such as web applications, WordPress, and Joomla.

</p>
<h5 >Host-Based Vulnerability Scanners
</h5>
<p class="section-flag">Used to find vulnerabilities on a single host or system such as an individual computer or a network device like a switch or core-router.</p>
<h5 >Network-Based Vulnerability Scanners</h5>
<p class="section-flag">Used to find vulnerabilities in an internal network by scanning for open ports. Services running on open ports determined whether vulnerabilities exist or not with the help of the tool.</p>
<h5 >atabase-Based Vulnerability Scanners</h5>
<p class="section-flag">Used to find vulnerabilities in database management systems. Databases are the backbone of any system storing sensitive information. Vulnerability scanning is performed on database systems to prevent attacks like SQL Injection.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Scanning for Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p class="section-flag">Vulnerability scanning keeps systems secure from external threats. Other benefits include:

  Affordable – Many vulnerability scanners are available free of charge.
  
  Quick – Assessment takes a few hours to complete.
  
  Automate – can use automated functions available in the vulnerability tools to perform scans regularly without manual involvement.
  
  Performance – vulnerability scanners perform almost all the well-known vulnerability scan.
  
  Cost/Benefit – reduce cost and increase benefits by optimizing security threats.
